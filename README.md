# DS&A: Data Structures - Stacks & Queues

## Today's Challenges:

You will add code to `index.js` and `index.test.js` to implement the data structures and methods listed below.

| person    | challenge                  |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| partner 1 | `Stack`                    |
| partner 2 | `Queue`                    |
| pair      | `O-1-dequeue`              |
| demo      | `reverse-array-with-stack` |
| pair      | `check-syntax`             |

## Abstract Data Structures

Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of operations.

The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view. The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.

## JavaScript Classes

```js
class MyDataStructure {
  #list = [];

  constructor(initialList) {
    // invoked via: new MyDataStructure()
    // not needed with private field initializers,
    // unless you need to do other work
    if (initialList) this.#list = initialList;
  }

  // methods

  addBack(item) {
    // access state, ie this.#list
    this.#list.push(item);
  }

  addFront(item) {
    // access state, ie this.#list
    this.#list.unshift(item);
  }

  // property

  get readableList() {
    // access state, ie this.#list
    return this.#list.toString();
  }

  get count() {
    // access state, ie this.#list
    return this.#list.length;
  }

  set count(count) {
    // access state, ie this.#list
    return (this.#list.length = count);
  }
}

// used like:

const myStructure = new MyDataStructure([4, 6, 8]);
// use the defined methods and properties to
// interact with this Abstract Data Structure:
myStructure.addFront(3);
myStructure.addFront(4);
myStructure.addBack(7);
myStructure.addBack(9);
console.log(myStructure.count);
// 7
console.log(myStructure.readableList);
// 4,3,4,6,8,7,9
```
